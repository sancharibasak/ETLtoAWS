AWS ETL Project Using Athena, Glue, and PySpark

**Project Overview**
This project demonstrates a complete Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process using AWS services such as AWS Glue and AWS Athena, with PySpark for data processing and transformation.
The project is designed to extract data from an AWS Athena view, apply necessary transformations, and load the processed data into an S3 bucket in the required format.

Project Components
The ETL process is split into three main scripts, each responsible for a specific stage:

Extract: extract.py
Transform: transform.py
Load: load.py
Each of these scripts is orchestrated using AWS Glue jobs, with SNS notifications to alert the team of any success or failure events.

************************************************
**Setup and Prerequisites**
To run this project, you will need the following:

1. An AWS account with access to Glue, S3, and Athena services.
2. A Glue service role with appropriate permissions.
3. SNS topic for notifications.
4. S3 buckets for storing the extracted, transformed, and final data.
5. AWS Glue Python SDK and AWS CLI configured on your local machine.

**Glue Job Configuration**
Each script uses AWS Glue's job parameter configurations. Make sure to update these configurations in the Glue console or in the script:

**Extract Job Parameters:**

--JOB_NAME: Name of the Glue job.
--sns_topic_arn: ARN of the SNS topic.
--athena_extract_path: S3 path to store extracted Athena data.
--TempDir: Temporary directory for intermediate results.
Transform Job Parameters:

--JOB_NAME: Name of the Glue job.
--sns_topic_arn: ARN of the SNS topic.
--athena_extract_path: S3 path containing extracted Athena data.
--transform_data_path: S3 path to store transformed data.
Load Job Parameters:

--JOB_NAME: Name of the Glue job.
--sns_topic_arn: ARN of the SNS topic.
--transform_data_path: S3 path containing transformed data.
--output_path: S3 path to store the final output files.
--target_path: S3 path to move and rename the final output files.

**Running the ETL Jobs**
1. Extract Phase: The extract phase pulls data from the specified Athena view and saves it in the specified S3 location as Parquet files.
# Command to run the Glue job for extraction
glueetl --JOB_NAME <Extract_Job_Name> --sns_topic_arn <SNS_Topic_ARN> --athena_extract_path <S3_Extract_Path> --TempDir <Temporary_Directory>

2. Transform Phase: In this phase, the extracted data is read and transformed using PySpark operations before being saved to a new S3 location.
# Command to run the Glue job for transformation
glueetl --JOB_NAME <Transform_Job_Name> --sns_topic_arn <SNS_Topic_ARN> --athena_extract_path <S3_Extract_Path> --transform_data_path <S3_Transform_Path>

3. Load Phase: The transformed data is processed, partitioned, and saved to the final target S3 path. The script also handles file renaming and cleanup.
# Command to run the Glue job for loading
glueetl --JOB_NAME <Load_Job_Name> --sns_topic_arn <SNS_Topic_ARN> --transform_data_path <S3_Transform_Path> --output_path <S3_Output_Path> --target_path <S3_Target_Path>


**Error Handling and Notifications**
Each script is designed to handle errors gracefully. If an error occurs during any phase, an SNS notification will be triggered with the error message and job details.

**Future Improvements**
Implement more complex transformations (e.g., aggregations, joins).
Add unit tests for PySpark transformation logic.
Automate the orchestration using AWS Step Functions or Apache Airflow.
